# Summary
* Developed a prototype of a digital wallet which has one main function that makes an alarm on your phone when it is disconnected from your phone.  
* This digital wallet is always connected with a user's phone through bluetooth connection, and if the user leaves their wallet, it is disconnected and gives you an alarm.  
* Also, it has a gps module on it so that whenever it is connected to nearby wifi it can send its location to the user's phone.  
* I implemented this whole system through Arduino IDE, Arduino Hardware, and an mobile application called Blynk with which you can easily get information from Arduino microcontroller board.
